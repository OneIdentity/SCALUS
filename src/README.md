# SCALUS Developer Guide

SCALUS consists of 3 major components:

* The CLI: Dispatches URL's to applications. Hosts the GUI.
* The GUI: Modifies the SCALUS URL -> application configuration.
* Build & Packaging: Cross platform build and packaging.

## Working with the SCALUS CLI

### Requirements

* [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

### Build

* Using Visual Studio

    Open the scalus.sln in Visual Studio and build.

* Using dotnet CLI

    Make sure you have nuget.org configured as a package source:

    ```
    dotnet nuget list source
    ```

    If not, add it:
    
    ```
    dotnet nuget add source -n Nuget.Org https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
    ```

    Use the dotnet CLI to build SCALUS:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

The following build parameters can be set to customize the build output:

* /p:Edition=&lt;community | safeguard&gt;

    Determines which edition to build. The Safeguard edition is supported by OneIdentity. Only binaries built and signed by OneIdentity are supported.

* /p:NativeWindowing=&lt;true | false&gt;

    Determines whether or not to use native Windowing features. This is currently only supported for Windows platforms. With NativeWindowing enabled SCALUS shows a splash screen on startup and does not display a console Window when invoked to handle a URL.

Example:
```
dotnet build /p:Edition=community /p:NativeWindowing=true
```

### Configuration

`appsettings.json` can be used to customize the runtime SCALUS behavior. Set MinLevel to `Debug` to get more detailed log file output. Set `Console` to true to log to the console window. Configuration files are stored in the user's profile folder as determined by the OS. Use the `scalus info` command to see full paths to log and configuration files.

```
{
  "Logging": {
    "FileName": "scalus.log",
    "MinLevel": "Information",
    "Console": true
  },
  "Configuration": {
    "FileName":  "scalus.json"
  }
}
```

### Usage

SCALUS command-line usage:
